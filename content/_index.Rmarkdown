## Coy's Page

### _Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler_

This website is a tool for me to explore, experiment, and catalog.  It will serve as place to collect my thoughts, record my challenges, and perhaps even showcase or self promote if I end up making anything worth sharing.

In the future, I will probably keep a particularly cool and/or recent graphic here on the homepage but for now please enjoy this photo of a smoky but beautiful trip through King's Canyon.
