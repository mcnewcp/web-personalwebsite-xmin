# Mortgage Refinance Calculator
### [mcnewcp.shinyapps.io/mortgage-refinance](https://mcnewcp.shinyapps.io/mortgage-refinance/)
This is a Shiny app that I made while deciding if we should refinance our mortgage.  I used it to run through many refinance options and pick the one that made the most financial sense for us.

# Nashville Crime Map
### [mcnewcp.shinyapps.io/nashville-crime-map](https://mcnewcp.shinyapps.io/nashville-crime-map/)
This is a Shiny app I made to investigate live crime data from data.Nashville.gov.  The user can browse individual reported crimes from any time period desired or aggregate based on a few polygon options and play with some fun 3D mapping tools.
