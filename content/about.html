<p>I am an academic turned consultant, brand new father, soccer <del>player</del> watcher, mountain connoisseur, and all around nerd. By building and maintaining this website, Iâ€™m hoping to encourage myself to see my half-baked ideas through, catalog my learning experiences for future reference, and <em>hopefully</em> showcase a few things that may just actually turn out well.</p>
